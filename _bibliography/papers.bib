   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the grand challenges facing human society. Much controversy exists around the complex and multifaceted pathogenesis of this prevalent disease. Given strong human genetic evidence, there is little doubt, however, that microglia play an important role in preventing degeneration of neurons. For example, loss of function of the microglial gene Trem2 renders microglia dysfunctional and causes an early-onset neurodegenerative syndrome, and Trem2 variants are among the strongest genetic risk factors for AD. Thus, restoring microglial function represents a rational therapeutic approach. Here, we show that systemic hematopoietic cell transplantation followed by enhancement of microglia replacement restores microglial function in a Trem2 mutant mouse model of AD.},

   abstract = {Hematopoietic cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning has been used to treat various genetic metabolic syndromes but is largely ineffective in diseases affecting the brain presumably due to poor and variable myeloid cell incorporation into the central nervous system. Here, we developed and characterized a near-complete and homogeneous replacement of microglia with bone marrow cells in mice without the need for genetic manipulation of donor or host. The high chimerism resulted from a competitive advantage of scarce donor cells during microglia repopulation rather than enhanced recruitment from the periphery. Hematopoietic stem cells, but not immediate myeloid or monocyte progenitor cells, contained full microglia replacement potency equivalent to whole bone marrow. To explore its therapeutic potential, we applied microglia replacement to a mouse model for Prosaposin deficiency, which is characterized by a progressive neurodegeneration phenotype. We found a reduction of cerebellar neurodegeneration and gliosis in treated brains, improvement of motor and balance impairment, and life span extension even with treatment started in young adulthood. This proof-of-concept study suggests that efficient microglia replacement may have therapeutic efficacy for a variety of neurological diseases.},
